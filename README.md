Fake Job Post Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques

Project Description

In today's digital era, job seekers often rely on online platforms to find employment opportunities. However, the surge of job advertisements has led to a dramatic rise in fake job postings, putting individuals at risk of scams, data theft, and financial loss. This project, "A Comparative Study on Fake Job Post Prediction Using Different Data Mining Techniques," addresses this growing concern by developing an intelligent system capable of detecting and classifying fake job posts.

The system leverages machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build predictive models. By analyzing features like job title, company details, job description, and qualifications, the system identifies key patterns that differentiate legitimate job postings from fraudulent ones.

The architecture is designed to enable real-time detection using lightweight detectors, while also allowing periodic model updates for adapting to new scam patterns. Built using Python, Django-ORM, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and MySQL, the project focuses on accuracy, efficiency, and scalability to ensure a trustworthy online recruitment experience.

Through this work, we aim to contribute to a safer job-seeking environment, assist in Human Resource Management, and enhance the reliability of online job portals.
